# Colors
# Colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
# For text colors (i.e. not background and bg* colors) you can also use
# the "bright" prefix to get a bright/bold color.  Example: brightblue
# You can use the "default" color, too (i.e. for transparent background).
# If your terminal supports 256 colors, you can use the color number
# directly (16-255).
#
# Have a look at the contrib/themes/ directory to see some sample
# color settings.
#

# You can color roster items by their status and JID.  For example, to have
# all roster items white, just all contacts from jabber.org that are away,
# not available or do not disturb yellow, you do this:

#color roster * * white
#color roster adn *@jabber.org yellow

# You can let mcabber color nicks in MUC.
# These colors will by used automatically:
#set nick_colors = red green blue
# This turns coloring of all mucs on:
#color muc * on

# If you want someone's nick to be the same all the time:
#color mucnick my_friend yellow
